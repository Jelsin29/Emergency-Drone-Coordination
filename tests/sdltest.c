 * @brief SDL2 graphics system validation and compatibility test
 * @version 0.1
 * @date 2025-05-22
 * 
 * This test program validates the SDL2 graphics library installation and
 * basic functionality before integration with the main drone coordination
 * visualization system. It provides a simple verification mechanism to
 * ensure SDL2 is properly installed and functioning on the target system.
 * 
 * **Test Coverage:**
 * - SDL2 library initialization and subsystem startup
 * - Window creation with specified dimensions and properties
 * - Event system functionality for user interaction
 * - Basic input handling (keyboard, mouse, window close)
 * - Proper cleanup and resource deallocation
 * - Cross-platform compatibility verification
 * 
 * **Platform Support:**
 * - **Linux**: Uses standard SDL2 system packages
 * - **macOS**: Supports both Homebrew and framework installations
 * - **Windows**: Compatible with SDL2 development libraries
 * 
 * **Compilation Instructions:**
 * ```bash
 * # Linux (with SDL2 development packages installed)
 * gcc sdltest.c -lSDL2 -o sdltest
 * 
 * # macOS (with SDL2 frameworks in /Library/Frameworks)
 * gcc sdltest.c -F/Library/Frameworks -framework SDL2 -o sdltest
 * 
 * # macOS (with Homebrew SDL2)
 * gcc sdltest.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs sdl2` -o sdltest
 * ```
 * 
 * **Expected Behavior:**
 * - Window opens with specified dimensions (800x600)
 * - Window remains responsive to user input
 * - Program exits on any key press, mouse click, or window close
 * - No error messages or crashes during execution
 * - Clean resource cleanup on exit
 * 
 * **Troubleshooting:**
 * If compilation fails, verify SDL2 development libraries are installed:
 * - Linux: `sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev` (Ubuntu/Debian)
 * - macOS: `brew install sdl2` (Homebrew)
 * - Windows: Download SDL2 development libraries from libsdl.org

/**
 * @brief Main SDL2 validation function with comprehensive testing
 * 
 * Performs a complete validation sequence of SDL2 functionality including
 * initialization, window creation, event handling, and cleanup. This test
 * verifies that all core SDL2 components required by the main application
 * are working correctly.
 * 
 * **Test Sequence:**
 * 1. **SDL Initialization**: Initialize video subsystem and event handling
 * 2. **Window Creation**: Create a visible window with specified dimensions
 * 3. **Event Loop**: Process user input events (key, mouse, window close)
 * 4. **Response Testing**: Verify immediate response to user interaction
 * 5. **Timeout Handling**: Automatic closure for non-interactive testing
 * 6. **Cleanup**: Proper resource deallocation and SDL shutdown
 * 
 * **Interactive Testing:**
 * - Any key press immediately closes the window
 * - Any mouse button click immediately closes the window
 * - Window close button (X) immediately closes the window
 * - ESC key can be used for quick exit
 * 
 * **Automated Testing:**
 * - Window closes automatically after DELAY milliseconds
 * - Suitable for continuous integration environments
 * - No user interaction required for basic validation
 * 
 * **Error Detection:**
 * - SDL initialization failures are reported with specific error messages
 * - Window creation failures include diagnostic information
 * - All errors use SDL_GetError() for detailed error reporting
 * - Exit codes indicate success (0) or failure (1)
 * 
 * **Resource Management:**
 * - Window handle is properly destroyed before exit
 * - SDL subsystems are cleanly shut down
 * - No memory leaks or resource handles left open
 * - Safe for repeated execution in test suites
 * 
 * @param argc Command-line argument count (unused but required for main)
 * @param argv Command-line argument array (unused but required for main)
 * @return 0 on successful SDL validation, 1 on any failure
 * 
 * @pre SDL2 development libraries must be installed on target system
 * @pre Display system must be available (X11, Wayland, etc.)
 * @post SDL subsystems are cleanly shut down regardless of exit path
 * 
 * @note Function parameters are unused but required for standard main signature
 * @note Window title clearly identifies this as a test program
 * @warning Failure return codes indicate SDL2 is not properly installed
 * 
 * @see SDL documentation for detailed error code meanings
 * @see Platform-specific installation guides for SDL2 setup
